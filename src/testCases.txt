Testing --> Manual and Automated Testing
Manual Testing is the one which we do in the browser after we write the code to check how it is visible to the users.
Automated Testing is the stranded procedure for testing a code, we write a code to test the code.
Types of Automated testing:
1) unit test.
2) integrated test.
3) end to end test

Unit test : test the individual fucntions or components in isolation, most common and important kind of testing.
Integrated test : test the combination of multiple blocks, intergrated tests is also important but focuses on unit test in most cases.
End to End test : test complete scenarios in your app ,important but can also done manually(partially)

tools used : jest and React Testing Library

writing test - the three A's
 A- arrange--setup test data, test conditions and test environment.
 A- act--run logic that should be tested
 A- assert--compare execution result with expected result.

 screen. we have various functions eg: get, find and query
 get functions throw error if an element is not found, query wont do that and find fucntions will return a promise.

 to group our test use describe("argument", () => {
     write your test here
 })
